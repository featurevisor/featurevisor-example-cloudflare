```
$ npm ci
```

## Usage

## Cloudflare

For this example, we are going to be uploading to and serving our datafiles from [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

Make sure you already have a Cloudflare Pages project set up, and then use it in the [`publish`](./.github/workflows/publish.yml) workflow.

## GitHub Actions

This example project is configured to run its CI/CD pipeline with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

You are free to choose any other CI/CD provider of your choice.

### Settings

Make sure you have `Read and write permissions` enabled in your GitHub repository's `Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions` section.

### Workflows

You can find the GHA workflow files in [`.github/workflows`](./.github/workflows) directory.

- `checks` workflow: runs against non-`master` (non-`main`) branches
- `publish` workflow: runs against `master` (`main`) branch

### Secrets

Follow the guide [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/how-to/use-direct-upload-with-continuous-integration/), and set up these two secrets in your GitHub repository's `Settings > Secrects and variables > Actions` section:

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
